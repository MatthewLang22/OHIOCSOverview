## To Install and Run Locally For Developers: 
  1. Install Pip for installation of jupyter-lab
  2. Install jupyter-lab command
      - Use ```pip install jupyterlab``` on command line to install
      - Link to orignal website: https://jupyter.org/install
  3. Git clone this repository
  4. Run jupyter by typing ```jupyter-lab``` in the terminal while in the directory of the repo
  5. If jupyter notebook doesn't open, you may need to open up a url gave by the terminal in a browser of your choice.

## To Install C++ Kernels Locally for Developers:
Note: At time of making the Xeus-Cling kernel does not support MacOS.

Steps to Install:
  1. Install Miniconda, current version can be found at
    https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
  2. create enviorment by executing the command ```conda create -n cling```
  3. Activate the enviorment by executing the command ```conda active cling```
  4. Now install Xeus cling by executing the command ```install xeus-cling jupyterlab -c conda-forge```

## To Install Rust Kernels Locally for Developers:
  1. Install Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install\
    you can do this by executing the command:\
     ```curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh```
  2. Install EVCXR REPL by executing: ```cargo install evcxr_repl```
  3. Create enviorment by executing: ```conda create --name evcxr```
  4. Activate enviorment by executing: ```conda activate evcxr```
  5. Install conda kernels by executing: ```conda install -y -c conda-forge nb_conda_kernels```
  6. Install evcxr_jupyter by executing: ```cargo install evcxr_jupyter```
  7. Install evcxr_jupyter by executing: ```evcxr_jupyter --install```

## To Install Scheme Locally for Developers:
Execute the following commands:
   1. ```pip3 install --upgrade calysto-scheme --user```
   2. ```python3 -m calysto_scheme install --user```
   
   Link to Scheme repo: https://github.com/Calysto/calysto_scheme

## Sci-Java Kernel Notes:
Due to the retirement of the kernel, we were unable to download and test java code locally.
